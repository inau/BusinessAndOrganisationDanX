\chapter{Strategic alignment report}
\label{chap:strategicalignmentreport}
The following section covers the strategic information on DANX. First it covers the strategic goals of DANX, their target group, their value propositions, and the rest of the business canvas.\\
The report contains information about the environment and presents the assessment in the form of a SWOT and competitor analysis. This is used as a basis for the in-depth analysis report.\\
Additionally it describes the work domains and the different departments affected by our solution.

\section{Business strategy}
In this section business strategy of DANX is analyzed. It contains information about key values, goals and challenges.\\
DANX has a general business strategy aimed at ensuring their customers get their spare parts fast and on time, and also ensure good support whenever there is a problem.\cite{gert027}\cite{gert025}\cite{lasse012}

\subsection{Canvas}
See section~\ref{sec:business_canvas} for the business canvas.\\
Fast delivery, overnight delivery and guaranteed pre 7 am\cite{gert001} delivery are key values of DANX in order to keep their customers satisfied and keep growing.\cite{mail}\cite{gert025}\cite{gert026} These values are only possible to their extent because of the key resources of DANX, Field Stock Locations and Pick-up/Drop-off locations, which greatly help DANX drivers to deliver fast and on time, and it allows customers to even pick up spare parts themselves. Companies which require fast and/or reliable delivery or just need external storage of spare parts are those that DANX focus on and will try to acquire.\\
DANX also has key values of fast and efficient IT support, as well as fast implementation of new customers into the IT systems of DANX, and even if new customers have not yet been integrated into the IT systems of DANX, they will start delivering from the day the new customers' former contract expired.\cite{lasse008} These values are more focused on good customer service which is an important resource for DANX. Even though the customer relationships are not personal, it is a good customer resource when possible customers can receive recommendations from current customers.\cite{bob002}

\subsection{Goals}
DANX has a general growth strategy ie. they want to gain 25-30 customers each year. Starting this year DANX is focusing on profit. Last year they had a profit of 10 million danish kroners, and a revenue of 250 million DKK. This year, It is expected that the revenue will increase to at least 300 million DKK and the profit to 20 million DKK. The overall goal is to have a revenue of at least 500 million DKK and a profit of eight to ten percent within 3-4 years.\cite{mail}\\
Since one of the key selling points of DANX is their pre 7 am delivery, they strive to deliver plus 99\% of the packages before 7 am.

\subsection{Values}
Reliability, Equality, Quality, Flexibility, Creativity, Availability and Pride are the seven values that DANX operate with.\cite{mail}

\begin{description}
\item[Reliability] DANX keeps their promises, correct their mistakes and proactively informs their customers.
\item[Equality] Customers, partners and colleagues are all equals and treated with the same respect.
\item[Quality] Customers are not taken for granted. 100\% is strived for in everything that is done. This ensures that customers of DANX can live up to their customers high expectations.
\item[Flexibility] - All employees and partners are expected to have a flexible mindset.
\item[Creativity] As pioneers DANX has to think outside the box to create solutions for the needs of their customer. DANX is constantly looking for ways to improve.
\item[Availability] DANX ensures the availability of all their customers spare parts through each employee’s personal care
\item[Pride] DANX takes pride in in everything they do. They are proud of their customers, company and their people.
\end{description}

\subsection{Challenges and problems}
It is cumbersome for the management of DANX to analyze the problems, the customers request help with, and how often a certain problem occurs.\cite{gert012} Furthermore it is difficult to collect information about a certain customer, e.g. how often they request help with a problem and what type of problems they need help with. No documentation for customer support means that it is impossible for DANX to track how many requests they receive, how fast they are resolved, and how much support the individual customer requests.\cite{gert011}\cite{gert012}
This makes it hard to detect any weaknesses in the customer support which is crucial for the service level. \\
The structure of requests for help regarding internals at DANX is non existent, which leads to Lasse using up to several minutes identifying the actual problem.\cite{lasse010} If the requests for help follows a predefined and clear structure, it would be easier to identify the actual problem. \\

Since DANX customers all have different systems, DANX needs to use a lot of different systems when accessing customer databases.\cite{lasse019} This leads to a lot of manuals for the employees at DANX, and getting to know all the systems for a new employee can be a slow process.\cite{opemployee001} If DANX strived to centralize all systems, this could result in a loss in flexibility towards customers. \\

Documentation of the work being done by the IT department is at an absolute minimum\cite{lasse007} making it impossible for managers to check what is actually being done, if the work is being done on time etc.
It can also be a problem if a system is developed and needs to be changed 3 months later. This can result in a complete re-written module for that system.\cite{lahib001} \\
Neither the IT department nor the operational department have any KPIs\cite{gert011}, making it difficult to asses whether or not things are going as planned. It can also serve as a de-motivating factor to the employees as they do not know if they are doing good or bad. It also makes it hard to figure out why it is going good or bad in the individual department. \\
Many of the companies DANX are delivering spare parts to, have their main storage department in either Holland\cite{gert001} or Germany\cite{gert002}. When a customer orders a spare part with pre 7 am delivery, the spare part is picked up at their storage department by DANX and shipped to where the customer needs it. If the spare part is going to another country than Denmark the part is in some cases transported by plane some of the way. This is a potential challenge because the plane can be delayed or have no room for cargo.
\section{Environment}
In this section the environment is analyzed. Firstly the competitors of DANX are investigated and secondly a SWOT analysis is conducted.
\subsection{Competitor analysis}
\label{sub:competitor_analysis}
\subsubsection{Competitors}
The main competitor of DANX is a special service within TNT called TNT innight.\cite{webpage001}
Just as DANX, TNT innight provides delivery of items within 7 am the following day.
TNT also targets some of the same segments as DANX such as:

\begin{itemize}
\item The car industry where they deliver spare parts to manufacturers and repair shops.
\item The medical industry where they make deliveries to hospitals
\item Farmers during the harvest season
\end{itemize}

Some of the advantages TNT has:
\begin{itemize}
\item TNT is a larger company\cite{tnt002}
\item Their own flight routes\cite{webpage001} from Bruxelles to Jönköping, Helsinki, Oslo, and Billund
\end{itemize}

We assume that since TNT is a larger company, they have the ability to invest more into infrastructure and can herby possibly offer a better service for less money.
Their own flight routes are a major strength as this grants a better quality compared to DANX. If one of DANX flights are canceled the goods are likely to be delayed, whereas this is less likely to happen at TNT.

Some of the disadvantages TNT has:
\begin{itemize}
\item A slower customer integration than DANX\cite{tnt001}
\end{itemize}

By not having the resources or know-how on how to integrate customers within 2-3 days, TNT may lose important customers with urgent needs.\\
Another competitor is HIT.\cite{malene001}\cite{webpage002} HIT provides the same service as DANX namely pre 7 am delivery during the night.\\
One of HIT’s advantages is they have a lot of companies to back them up such as posten.se and Postdanmark A/S.\cite{webpage002}\cite{webpage012} This increases the capital in the company which is important, in order to keep a high level of infrastructure.

\subsubsection{Substitution}
Another competitor with a possible substitutional service would be FedEx.\cite{webpage004} FedEx is offering a similar service on a national basis where you can send a national priority package. It will usually be delivered within 12 am the following work day, depending on where the package is going from and to. While this is not entirely the same service as DANX provide, some customers who have a need to send national packages may choose this option, since the time may be the same as DANX if they happen to be shipping at that time. The customer is able to check the time of delivery when they request the delivery on FedEx’s website.\cite{webpage011}

\subsubsection{New market entrants}
There are already a few existing companies which in the future, might be interested in expanding their service and providing pre 7 am delivery. Some of these companies are DHL and UPS.\\
This would require a lot of internal restructuring of DHL and UPS, but since the only major players are DANX and TNT it should be possible to gain some of the market share. The companies would also have to change their goals to aim for a lot higher quality when delivering pre 7 am. They also have advantages in form of their size, brand, and current customer base.

\end{tabular}
\qquad

\textbf{Strengths}
\begin{itemize}
\item Customer integration within 3 days is a lot better than their competitors. When a customer’s previous contract expires they need a new one as soon as their old one expires, and if the other companies cannot provide that due to the IT solution not being ready on time, they will lose a customer to (possibly) DANX.
\item PUDOs are costly to maintain. DANX has customers in Sweden that are willing to pay for this. This means DANX now can offer this service to other customers as well in order to improve their service.\cite{gert023}
\item Lots of small subcontractors means it is easy for DANX to remove and add new sub contractors in busy periods/seasons.
\item Direct support is very important as a part of the quality and service DANX provides to their customers. This allows the customer to call or email Lasse directly with questions related to the integration between the IT systems of DANX and the IT systems of the customer.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Weaknesses}
\begin{itemize}
\item With new customers comes new systems, leading to the training of new employees taking longer time.\cite{opemployee001} Besides the training of new employees, the current employees must also learn the new systems. Increased training time and ongoing training of existing employees leads to increased cost when expanding.
\item With the rapid expansion DANX is experiencing it is difficult to asses if their high quality service is retained, if they can not measure how well a certain department is performing.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Opportunities}
\begin{itemize}
\item DANX can gain free experience from their ELSA partners which they have not done yet. This is a way to learn more about alternate methods which may be better, and make them stand stronger on the northern market.\cite{gert010}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Threats}
\begin{itemize}
\item The lack of own flight routes means that DANX is dependant that the flights are not delayed, and that they accept their cargo. If they do not, the delivery will be delayed which causes bad reputation and quality.
\end{itemize}

\section{Work Domains}
DANX Nordic is situated in Vallensbæk, Denmark. The company has organisations in Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark.\\
Within each organisation there is a flat structure\cite{gert028}, where one regional director is sitting at the top, followed by an operations manager and a sales manager. At the bottom we have a number of contracted drivers responsible for the final delivery of the spare parts \cite{gert022}\cite{malene002} - these are independent of DANX but are hired to carry out their bidding.\\
The nordic branch is different from the regional organisations in the sense that it has an IT-department and a marketing department. These are used by all regional organisations and the centralisation of these aligns DANX different departments both in IT as well as marketing and customer relations.\\
For this project the important departments to consider are:

\subsection{IT department}
The IT department at DANX consists of Lasse Trier, the head of IT development department\cite{lasse014}, and three employees. The department develops IT systems, such as the TrackIT system\cite{lasse015}, which is used in all of the department. They are also responsible for integration with customers systems. When DANX gets a new customer the IT department make sure that it will only take a few days before they have fully implemented the integration between IT systems of DANX and the customer’s IT system.\cite{lasse008}\\
They are also using a lot of resources on handling internal and customer support related to software inside DANX\cite{lasse016}, such as the TrackIT system and the software implemented in order to connect and communicate with customers systems. This support helps with using the systems and correct bugs when they occur. They give support by email and phone, and if it is customer support, the operational department will typically have received it first and read it through and then forwarded it to the it department afterwards\cite{lasse001} if it is not something they can handle themselves.\cite{lasse017} \\
The IT department is an important work domain to focus on as they are an important support for customers and internal staff regarding complications with internal systems. Lasse is a key resource for DANX as he is responsible for integrating new customers.\cite{lasse018} This is a very important activity for DANX and one of it’s key strengths, which means that it can conflict with the business goals to gain new customers. Since Lasse is the only person able to integrate them, it either becomes a bottleneck for the business goals, or DANX could increase the time spent on creating the customer integration. Lowering the standards would mean DANX lost a strength compared to their competitors.

\subsection{Operational department}
The head of the operational department is Gert Phillipsen, the Operations Manager.\\
The operations department is the main department, both in regards to internal coordination of packages as well as customer support requests.\cite{gert004} They propagate support requests when they are unable to fix the issues.\cite{lasse017}\\
The control tower is part of the operational department and is always open. It serves as a reliable contact for their customers and ensures that any problems that may hinder delivery of spare parts are addressed.\cite{gert004}\\
Aside from the customer support the operation is also responsible for managing the different sub contractors, either when something goes wrong, or if a driver is insecure on how to proceed.

\subsection{IT support department}
The IT support department of DANX consist of 2 employees. Their job is to maintain internal support regarding hardware problems. They share email with the IT development department.\cite{lasse003}

\subsection{Conclusion}
As the IT department is a significant bottleneck for DANX it might be worth analyzing in the in-depth analysis. The problem is that the fast integration and good customer support values of DANX are dependent on Lasse because he is the only person with full insight into the IT systems that supports these values.\cite{lasse011} This means that as DANX grows the workload on Lasse will increase to a point where he can no longer keep up.\\
Unfortunately it is very difficult to train/employ an additional employee with the same functionality as Lasse Trier, since Lasse needs to spend time on this, that he does not have. It is not feasible to extend the deadlines of Lasse’s work as customers need it right away, and that this is one of the main strengths of DANX.
