\section*{Contract}
The project is conducted for learning purposes in order to simulate the actual work done in the MUST method for the course Business Processes and Organisation, Fall 2013, at the IT university of Copenhagen. The project will not produce any final products other than a business case and associated appendix. The project will be supervised by Nina Boulus-Roedje and Elisabeth Broe Christensen.

\section*{Purpose of project charter}
The project charter defines the objective of the project and what work has to be done to reach this objective, as well as which resources the project team needs from DANX and which deliverables the company will receive.

The project charter serves as a contract between the project team and DANX, such that everyone involved in the project has the same view of the vision, assumptions, planning, resource consumption and boundaries of the project.


\section*{Premise}
\subsubsection*{Scope}
The scope of the project includes internal communication, not communication with customers and others outside of DANX. In other words this means that customers will still have the same high degree of service and availability from all IT-staff whereas the internal communication should be handled in a fashion where the developer stress is reduced or avoided. 

\subsubsection*{Critical preconditions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item It must be possible for the project group to observe how the work flow of DANX is on a regular day.
	\item The project group can conduct interviews with persons relevant to the assignment.
	\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Assignment and Objective}
The IT-development department of DANX serves many purposes, some of which are crucial for delivery of the company’s service.

However the department handles problems which are less relevant for the delivery of the service, which has potential to be optimized* or removed from the responsibilities of the IT department. \\

Employees of the IT development department spend time on prioritizing, investigating and solving problems that are not related to IT development and customer service, which can be reduced. \\

How do the employees of the IT development department reduce the time spent on solving problems that are not related to IT development or customer service?
\\ \\
The problem is solved if the IT-department uses 15\% less time on solving problems not related to IT-development or customer service one year after the solution has been deployed.
\\
\small{*time spent of solving problem reduced.}\\
